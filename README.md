# AGI Portfolio Signals

Portfolio Signals is the multi-tenant **decision workspace** of **Autonomously Giving Incorporated (AGI)**. AGI is the customer-facing corporate brand; Zero State is credited only as the software builder. Impact Relay is the tenant-isolated financial and impact backend.

**Live:** [autogive.app/portfolio-signals](https://autogive.app/portfolio-signals/) · **Workspace:** [autogive.app/portfolio-signals/workspace](https://autogive.app/portfolio-signals/workspace)  
**Platform Supabase:** `utdioxwiskzatwoejgiu` · **Reference tenant:** Hacker Dojo (`org_hacker_dojo`) — pilot/regression fixture, **not** product identity (tenant assets under `assets/tenants/hacker-dojo/`).

See [docs/AGI-SUITE-ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/AGI-SUITE-ARCHITECTURE.md) for boundaries, and [docs/CURRENT-STATE.md](docs/CURRENT-STATE.md) / [docs/START_HERE.md](docs/START_HERE.md) for live ops status.

## Platform specification status

Portfolio Signals currently declares **Experimental** conformance to [Autonomous Giving Platform Specification v1.0.0](https://github.com/scrimshawlife-ctrl/Autonomous-Giving-Specs/tree/v1.0.0). It is not yet a producer of the canonical Signal, Opportunity, or Recommendation contracts. The migration boundary and exit criteria are documented in [docs/PLATFORM-CONFORMANCE.md](docs/PLATFORM-CONFORMANCE.md).

The repository now contains both a privacy-safe public director portal and the controlled foundation for an authenticated campaign workspace. It does **not** contain member, donor, attendee, or relationship-level source data.

## Platform specification

Pinned platform canon: **[Autonomous Giving Specs v1.0.0](https://github.com/scrimshawlife-ctrl/Autonomous-Giving-Specs/releases/tag/v1.0.0)**.

Conformance declaration: [`platform-spec/conformance.yml`](platform-spec/conformance.yml). See [`platform-spec/README.md`](platform-spec/README.md).

## Allocation middleware

Transaction-light **middleware** between donation platforms (canonical **every.org**) and human allocation: pots → allocate → proof → exception inbox → board packet. Not a finance ledger.

**Status (2026-08-07):** MVP shipped; **local pilot smoke PASS** against platform Supabase (director auth config on). Production public host and live every.org webhook still open. **Default host:** Docker Compose / local Node. **Optional hosts:** Fly.io, Render, Railway.

```bash
cd services/allocation-middleware
npm test
# .env.pilot from platform keys (gitignored) — see docs/ALLOCATION-DIRECTOR-LOGIN.md
npm run compose:up   # or: npm run start:hacker-dojo:seed
BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8787 npm run pilot:smoke
BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8787 npm run verify:director
```

| [docs/HACKER-DOJO-ALLOCATION-PILOT.md](docs/HACKER-DOJO-ALLOCATION-PILOT.md) | Pilot runbook |

| [services/allocation-middleware/README.md](services/allocation-middleware/README.md) | npm scripts |

Portfolio Signals’s suite role is **observe/credit** (gift summaries → pot balances). Deep evidence verification remains Impact Relay’s long-term boundary; the MVP co-locates allocate/proof/packet for the modular-monolith pilot.

## Current evidence boundary

**As of 2026-08-07** (suite production on `autogive.app` + platform Supabase). See [docs/CURRENT-STATE.md](docs/CURRENT-STATE.md) for the full live receipt. Older HD-OI-041 staging receipts are **historical** only.

## Campaign architecture

```yaml
minimum_target: 420000
stretch_target: 2000000
campaign_event: SupperHappyFundHouse
campaign_event_date: 2026-08-21
proposition: Keep the room where builders become possible.
call_to_action: Come home. Build something. Fund the next builder.
```

Proposed funding thresholds remain subject to director and board approval:

```yaml
stabilization: 420000
growth: 750000
expansion: 1200000
transformation: 2000000
```

## Public impact surface and Impact Relay host

Live public donation progress, use-of-funds receipts, and event digests are published on **Impact Relay** (aggregate-only, no CRM data):

https://autogive.app/impact-relay/

Repository: https://github.com/scrimshawlife-ctrl/Impact-Relay

This repo is the **canonical host app** for Impact Relay (campaign UX + Supabase auth). The library owns ledger, durable workflows, and console APIs; this app owns screens and identity.

| Surface | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `finance-impact.html` | L3 expense approval queue |
| `donor-impact.html` | Donor timeline / UOF receipt detail |
| `workspace/impact-relay-bridge.js` | Supabase JWT / fixture Bearer → IR console (no X-Impact forge headers) |
| `docs/IMPACT-RELAY.md` | Bridge runbook (roles, MFA, auth modes) |
| `docs/IMPACT-RELAY-SHADOW.md` | Finance shadow mode (no live notify) |
| `docs/IMPACT-RELAY-LIVE-COHORT.md` | Limited live cohort procedure |

```bash
# from Impact-Relay checkout — default-deny; no --trusted-proxy for host UI
python -m impact_relay.console_server --data-dir .impact-relay/hacker-dojo --port 8787
# then open finance-impact.html / donor-impact.html from this repo
# (fixture Bearer without runtime-config.js; Supabase JWT when configured)
# See docs/IMPACT-RELAY.md — --trusted-proxy only behind a stripping gateway
```

Privileged campaign roles must have MFA enforced before Impact Relay screens accept the session (same rule as director workspace).

## Privacy and authority boundary

The repository must never contain:

- raw member or attendee registries;
- personal email addresses, phone numbers, or street addresses;
- donation histories or private donor notes;
- relationship scores or contact recommendations;
- consent, suppression, or outreach state tied to real people;
- private campaign documents;
- production credentials or service-role values;
- native development workbooks (`.xlsx` / `.csv` exports with campaign records).

GitHub Pages is a public publishing surface, not a CRM access-control layer. Restricted records belong only in **local operator custody** until upload, then in **Supabase** (Postgres RLS + `campaign-private` storage). Notion may hold strategy and aggregate public evidence; it is **not** the CRM system of record.

The source development list is evidence, not outreach authorization. A historical relationship, attendance record, or Meetup export does not establish consent to fundraising contact.

See [docs/DATA-PLACEMENT.md](docs/DATA-PLACEMENT.md) for the placement matrix, staging project ref, and offline source inventory (hashes and counts only).

## Local public-portal preview

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Open `http://localhost:8080`.

## Validate the public campaign contract

The CI workflow loads `ajv-formats` so the schema retains strict standard date validation.

```bash
npx --yes \
  --package ajv-cli@5 \
  --package ajv-formats@3 \
  ajv validate \
  --spec=draft2020 \
  -c ajv-formats \
  -s schemas/public-campaign.schema.json \
  -d data/public-campaign.json
```

## Local Supabase policy validation

The executable workflow performs the following sequence against a disposable local project:

1. Start the pinned Supabase stack.
2. Reset the database and apply the complete migration chain.
3. Resolve and validate the local database URL.
4. Load synthetic profiles for all six roles.
5. Execute RLS and import-policy acceptance tests.
6. Stop and discard the local stack.

PR #14 observed a green disposable run for migrations, six-role fixtures, and RLS acceptance checks. This repository now also executes the synthetic import-gate corpus (confirmed, restricted, duplicate, suppressed, unauthorized promotion, and eligible promotion) in that same workflow.

## Staging Supabase project

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Project ref | `ecxkhihlbrcwpavfoaoq` |
| Dashboard | https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ecxkhihlbrcwpavfoaoq |
| API host | `https://ecxkhihlbrcwpavfoaoq.supabase.co` |
| Role | Staging (default) until leadership names production |
| Schema push | Operator: `supabase link --project-ref ecxkhihlbrcwpavfoaoq` then `supabase db push` |
| Browser config | Gitignored `runtime-config.js` from `scripts/staging/runtime-config.staging.example.js` |

CI continues to use a **disposable** local Supabase stack. Linking the hosted project does not apply migrations or load data by itself.

## Required before any real record is imported

- apply and verify migrations on staging (then production when approved);
- enforce MFA for privileged roles;
- configure deployment secrets and key rotation (never commit service-role keys);
- deploy and verify private object-storage policies (`campaign-private`);
- verify signed-URL expiration and audit events;
- execute positive and negative tests for every role (synthetic fixtures only first);
- approve privacy, consent, retention, suppression, and export rules;
- approve the $420K use-of-funds schedule and sponsor benefits;
- name accountable campaign and data owners;
- authorize a specific native workbook (SHA-256) through the quarantine workflow.
